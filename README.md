# ud4lhud
 a hud for fivem made by ud4l
 has :
 animated health/armour bar's,
 player ID indicator,
 microphone indicator that turns green when player starts talking.
if im not wrong there still shoud be some traces of a speedometer left, so if u prefer to keep it clean, remove em, il remove them myself in the next update.
